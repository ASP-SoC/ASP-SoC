# About

The aim of this project is to create a universal standalone customizable audio signal processing chain on a FPGA SoC.

The audio processing is realized in hardware and the configuration/visualisation interface is based on a Linux OS on the ARM Core of the system. The software is based on a webpage which is hosted on the OS, so one can easily access it with any device including a webbrowser, such as your PC, Laptop or Smartphone. 

The platform is fully configurable, so you simply can change the routing or add new components/blocks to the processing chain.

Planned blocks are:

* Equalizer
* Audio Effects
* Generic Filters
* Spectral Analysis
* Signal Generator
